This is a repo consisting on basic Malwares that are supposed to be 
studied for those having interest in starting their Malware 
Development journey and are willing to be "ETHICAL" in both Windows 
and Linux.

**Note:** These sample malwares aren't ready for any kind of Evasion or OP-SEC for Stealth, just for the learning purposes
